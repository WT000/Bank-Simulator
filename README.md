# COM528AE1
This is our groups submission for the AE1 for COM528, a credit card app that uses ReST with a front-facing UI built with JSP for users.

# REPO INSTRUCTIONS
Because we're working on this as a team, always ensure you pull the repo before git pushing! We don't want peoples work to be overwritten.

Always git pull / fetch the upstream when you want to work on the project in case someone has made changes.
Always pull before pushing your own changes too!

# TODO (will be removed)
GitHub actions to automatically build maven and run tests on push
