# REPO INSTRUCTIONS
Because we're working on this as a team, always ensure you pull the repo before git pushing! We don't want peoples work to be overwritten.

In a nutshell, do git pull whenever you open the project and git pull whenever you're about to git push, allowing you to check for merge conflicts.

If you're going to do a potentially damaging change, make sure you create and try the changes on a new branch and merge it with main if you know it works & tests didn't fail.

If changes you make cause tests to fail then please try to fix them or revert the change until someone else can!

# CODE FORMATTING
When coding, make sure you follow standards and general practices:

ClassName

methodName

Don't start classes or methods with a number.

Don't use confusing variable names.

Space out code where needed, make sure it's readable to everyone as we're working on this as a group!

Comment your code.
